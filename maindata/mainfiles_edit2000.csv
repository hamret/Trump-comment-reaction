Companies should start price labelling their products with the (RTT) Republican Trump Tax. e.g. $4.99 + RTT $12.23,3 days ago,CNBC,1
"Tariffs are paid by the companies. Consumers pay for products at retail, and if that company increases a price then they may lose that sale to a competitor. If one company wants to gain market-share then they can eat more of the costs while contracting existing US shoe makers to tool up for making their shoes. None of the companies making products like clothing have the monopoly needed for passing the costs completely to the customer.",8 days ago,CNBC,2
"Ok lets start from way back a few years ago, the US Industry started to reduce US workmanship hours because it was too expensive to keep jobs in the US, due to this  the final price of USA made goods was going to increase $$ increase $$$ increase$$$$,  because of this  US manufacturer starting looking abroad to other countries to find a way to reduce workmanship cost and keep their prices competitive creating global manufactures alliances,  this SMART move 30+ years ago, started this diversification to source parts, components and reduce the US production Process (because CEO's wanted to keep their pocket filled up).. So,  now your President TRUP (who is an ignorant by excellence and a scum bag by trade, that always in all of this own businesses took advantage of business ppl all his life) He decided that the OTHER countries that HELPED the US in reducing COST and maintain their competitiveness are the one ""Taking advantage of the poor US"" so who open the door initially to come up to this situation?? It  was  the US themselves, including all the EX-Presidents, US Governments in the last 20, 30 years... That's is how GLOBAL Economy works!! Creating agreement and respect them thru the years! (I'm sure a 15 year old could understand this... but no FRUMP a Convicted felon elected by ""ignorant"" who also do not understand about politics (as they got tricked by a clown) nor economics but like to Drive the BIG AMERICAN TRUCK! ( well, let me tell you..  is not American  TRUCK.. its an international TRUCK!! Good luck America, you are going down the toilet! The best outcome of all this craziness, is that the world will become stronger and NEW politic and business alliances will form.... without the USA!!! bon voyage losers!  ( Another side effect of this tariff implementation is the increase of Beaurocracy and the opportunity to create more scams,   I'm sure TRUMP is going to create a ""TARIFF Government Office"" to collect this $$$ coming in, and somehow a big $$$%% will go into TRUMP pockets... prove me wrong!) Economy is NOT a GAME!!

Ok, comencemos desde hace unos a?os, la Industria Estadounidense comenz? a reducir la mano the obra estadounidense porque era demasiado caro, mantener los empleos en los EE. UU., debido a esto, el precio final de los bienes fabricados en EE. UU. iba a aumentar $$ aumentar $$$ aumentar$$$$, debido a que esto, los fabricantes estadounidense comenzaron a buscar en el extranjero a otros pa?ses para encontrar una manera de reducir el costo de la mano de obra y mantener sus precios competitivos creando alianzas Globales, este movimiento INTELIGENTE hace m?s de 30 a?os, comenz? esta diversificaci?n para obtener piezas, componentes y reducir el proceso de producci?n de EE. UU. (porque los CEO quer?an mantener sus bolsillos llenos) .. Entonces, ahora su presidente TRUP (que es un ignorante por excelencia y una escoria de oficio, que siempre en todos sus propios negocios se aprovech? de los empresarios toda su vida) decidi? que los OTROS pa?ses que AYUDARON a los EE. UU. a reducir COSTOS y mantener su competitividad son los que ""se aprovechan de los pobres EE. UU."", entonces, ¢¯qui?n abri? la puerta inicialmente para llegar a esta situaci?n?

Fueron los propios EE. UU., incluyendo a todos los expresidentes y gobiernos estadounidenses de los ?ltimos 20 o 30 a?os que negociaron estos acuerdos de cooperaci?n Industrial.... ... ¢®As? funciona la econom?a global! ¢®Creando acuerdos y respet?ndolos a lo largo de los a?os! (Estoy seguro de que un chico de 15 a?os podr?a entender esto... pero no FRUMP, un delincuente convicto elegido por ""ignorantes"" que tampoco entienden de pol?tica (ya que fueron enga?ados por un payaso) ni de econom?a, ¢®pero les gusta conducir el GRAN CAMI?N AMERICANO! (Bueno, d?jame decirte... no es un CAMI?N estadounidense... ¢®es un CAMI?N internacional! ¢®Buena suerte, Estados Unidos, te est?s yendo al traste! El mejor resultado de toda esta locura es que el mundo se volver? m?s fuerte y se formar?n NUEVAS alianzas pol?ticas y comerciales... ¢®sin los EE. UU.! ¢®Buen viaje, perdedores! (Otro efecto secundario de esta implementaci?n arancelaria es el aumento de la burocracia y la oportunidad de crear m?s estafas, estoy seguro de que TRUMP va a crear una ""Oficina Gubernamental ARANCELARIA"" para recaudar este $$$ que entra, y de alguna manera un gran $$$%% ir? a los bolsillos de TRUMP... ¢®demu?strame que estoy equivocado!) ¢®La econom?a NO es un JUEGO!

Ok, vamos come?ar de alguns anos atr?s, a ind?stria dos EUA come?ou a reduzir as horas de trabalho nos EUA porque era muito caro manter empregos nos EUA, devido a isso o pre?o final dos produtos feitos nos EUA iria aumentar $$ aumentar $$$ aumentar$$$$, por causa deste fabricante dos EUA come?ou a olhar para o exterior para outros pa?ses para encontrar uma maneira de reduzir o custo de m?o de obra e manter seus pre?os competitivos criando alian?as globais de fabricantes, esta jogada INTELIGENTE h? mais de 30 anos, come?ou esta diversifica??o para obter pe?as, componentes e reduzir o processo de produ??o dos EUA (porque os CEOs queriam manter seus bolsos cheios). Ent?o, agora seu presidente TRUP (que ? um ignorante por excel?ncia e um canalha por profiss?o, que sempre em todos os seus pr?prios neg?cios tirou vantagem das pessoas de neg?cios durante toda a sua vida) Ele decidiu que os OUTROS pa?ses que AJUDARAM os EUA a reduzir CUSTO e manter sua competitividade s?o os que ""Tiram vantagem dos pobres EUA"", ent?o quem abriu a porta inicialmente para chegar a esta situa??o??
Foram os pr?prios EUA, incluindo todos os EX-Presidentes, Governos dos EUA nos ?ltimos 20, 30 anos... ? assim que a Economia GLOBAL funciona!! Criando acordo e respeitando-os ao longo dos anos! (Tenho certeza de que um garoto de 15 anos entenderia isso... mas n?o FRUMP, um criminoso condenado eleito por ""ignorantes"" que tamb?m n?o entendem de pol?tica (pois foram enganados por um palha?o) nem de economia, mas gostam de dirigir o GRANDE CAMINH?O AMERICANO!

O melhor resultado de toda essa loucura ? que o mundo se tornar? mais forte e NOVAS alian?as pol?ticas e comerciais se formar?o... sem os EUA!!! Boa viagem, perdedores! (Outro efeito colateral dessa implementa??o de tarifas ? o aumento da burocracia e a oportunidade de criar mais golpes, tenho certeza de que TRUMP criar? um ""Gabinete do Governo de TARIFAS"" para coletar esse $$$ que est? entrando, e de alguma forma uma grande $$$%% ir? para os bolsos de TRUMP... provem que estou errado!)

But actually it serves a purpose to restore manufacturing jobs in America  and also prevent countries like China from using Canada and Mexico as a back door to avoiding tariffs.  It is also about illegal immigration because Mexico does hardly anything to secure it's border while US border patrol spends billions securing the border.

Whereas my current pay for driving a truck is only $24 an hour with no benefits or insurance, it is very unlikely my employer is going to raise my pay to $50 an hour to help offset higher cost and living expenses. So in a nutshell, the tariffs won't directly affect China, Mexico, or even Canada, but rather it is intended to hurt the average American citizen who are already living on shoestring budgets.

If tariffs are put in place, at some point, depending on how high the tariffs are, it will make more sense economically to make these cars in the US rather than Mexico as the tariffs will offset the lower cost of labor in Mexico. That, in turn, will lead to an increase in car manufacturing in the US and thus manufacturing jobs.

"¡¤ 
When you are covetous, you will fall into the hole of greed that you are digging when it is deep and large enough to swallow you. RIGHTEOUSNESS EXALTS A NATION AND COVETOUSNESS CAUSES ITS DOWNFALL
 Japan for example, the government have covetous politicians and top civil servants that make themselves very rich by 1] depriving their working class of their livelihoods through ever raising the costs of living; 2] ever increasing rental for offices, shops and factories to bankrupt them eventually and 3] ever increasing the prices of their products till not many around the world could afford to buy. Then came the last great recession that really make Japan to recover to normalcy very very very hard. The result of covetousness in governing by a covetous leader and his political appointees is MORE JAPANESE DO NOT GET MARRIED because they cannot afford to support a family because everything is expensive in the cities. With low birth rate, Japan will import foreign workers continuously and when the number is great enough, they would, perhaps, elect a non-Japanese PM. Fortunately, the Japanese government did not indulge in massive investments around the world using their reserves BELONGING TO THE PEOPLE otherwise when hit with crisis like covid-19, Japan would go bankrupt - banks no monies as reserves lost in hugh local and foreign venturing investments. Then people would go hungry before the country collapses financially as the reserves are depleted or monies[liquid cash] has turned into rocks and stones[modern buildings and structures that were built with UNCONTROLL corruptions that run and run among the politcal appointees thus raising the costs of living yearly ONLY TO CAUSE THE FINANCIAL COLLAPSE OF THE COUNTRY]!  
 No economy can be sustained when the leader of a country allows its political appointees to bankrupt retailers, exporters and manufacturers by ever increasing rental just to gain bigger bonuses and higher salaries. A WISE PM WOULD KEEP THE WORKING CLASS, RETAILERS, MANUFACTURERS, IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS RICH BY NOT OVERTAXING THEM LEST WHEN WAR COMES THERE WOULD BE NO ONE TO FALL UPON FOR SUPPORT. President Trump, a wise businessman, who has knowledge that has understanding coming from God[Proverb 2:6] wisely supports financially the working class knowing that it is the working class that keep the economy running well, and when they get old, the elderly must be well taken care of. Also not forgetting the important role of  the manufacturers, retailers and exporters in sustaining the economy of the country!",2 months ago,CNBC,2

"A Price increase is a given with tariffs. The ultimate goal is to change consumer behavior. As the prices move up for imports, for a while American products will be cheaper and consumers will select American products. Once prices go up for both imports and American products, more American players will jump in to reap the profits. As more American players jump in, they will start competing with each other based on price. The important thing is to get Americans to invest in business, and create new businesses, with tax incentives companies will relocate to the US,  to take advantage of a low-tax market opportunity. This new business will need American workers, creating employment opportunities for American workers.  Will it be painful? Yes! Just as painful as it was in the 1990s when our businesses went bankrupt due to free-trade policies. My brother-in-law ran a machine tooling business for over 30 years and suddenly when the US government signed the free trade deal with China, he lost everything.

Oh, cut bolony; we who have been in the workforce for over 30 years and learned how the military operates know very well that big fat juicy government jobs are given to UNQUALIFIED ex-military who in turn give big fat juicy government CONTRACTS to their ex-military working in the CONTRACTING companies.

Why GIVING? Because within the government, the military in government jobs will out-qualified people to bring in unqualified ex-military and have no one to answer to when 

That is why our government is EFUP SO BAD because it's all run by incompetent, unqualified ex-military.

If an ex-military gets wild hair up his rear, he can cancel a billion-dollar government contract without rhyme or reason, with no one to answer to because he did it to get his AMIGO THE CONTRACT. He can then leave the government position and +3 years (per government policy) get a nice $250,000 a year job with his AMIGO in the contracting company.

CROOKED AS ALL HE... ...L just like the Chinese.

It's why peasants, like the average Joe, at best, can make only $150,000 a year and only if they know the crooked contacts in the government. 

So our government, especially FEDERAL, where the military reigns and the juicier contracts are, is no better than the Chinese.

"We need to not depend on China for anything. I'm surprised business people have not found suppliers elsewhere. They had 8 years now to disengage from China. Tariffs on China is likely to never end, and will probably increase. China has always had significant  tariffs on our exports to them. They always had : 
13%, applicable mostly to manufactured goods; 9%, applicable mostly to agricultural and utility goods; 6%, applicable to services. China will now add additional tariffs of 15% on coal and liquefied natural gas imports from the U.S (=28%)., China will now also levy 10%  higher duties (=23%) on American crude oil, farm equipment, and certain cars and trucks.
As Marco Rubio said, it's time to reciprocate. So obviously our tariffs on China will more than double in times to come.

 Maybe American companies should build factories to build what you now buy from China ?
  Tariffs on Canada and Mexico is probably more talk than action. Trump is just trying to get their cooperation stopping deadly drugs and people, which is in everybody's interests,  and China using them to tranship it's trade through them to avoid our custom duties.

"Trump imposes 25% tariffs which equate to Walmart's entire gross margin on sales. Logically, Walmart MUST raise prices by 25%, or earn no profit at all.  Yet people blame the US firms for ""greed,"" but exonerate the guy who decreed the taxes that caused the problem.  Some front-loading exists, but to carry excess inventory also entails a cost that eats into margins.   As of the quarter ending 31-Oct-24, Walmart had 45 days of inventory on hand, versus 41 days at the 31-Jan-24 close of the prior fiscal year.  No, Walmart did not have any big buffer against tariffs imposed by Trump, whose margin of election victory (by a hair) was not predicted by most polls.  Consider Walmart a proxy for many US vendors.  All need to make money.   Very few will gain from tariffs.  Most will not.  No, I do not work for Walmart.  My observations are based on the firm's own IR disclosures.  All-in-all, Trump's impending trade war will simply raise prices, contribute to a recession, subsidize fewer jobs than it destroys, and alienate much of the world from a country whose objectives have now become predatory, destructive, and ridiculous.",2 months ago (edited),CNBC,

"UNDERSTAND?THIS?AMERICA?!!?MAGA: = Moscow Agent (¡®Krasnov¡¯) Governing America

Ukraine  had an absolutely identical situation in Ukraine, when the Russian agent Yanukovych won the presidential elections back  in 2010.

The fact that he was recruited by the Russian security service the FSB has already been well documented at this point (he is now living in MOSCOW with 40 billion dollars of stolen Ukrainian state funds. 

The people of Ukraine, were absolutely confused. when Putins boy Yanukovych took office ; when they  did not know what to do. they were apathetic and had no leaders. 

When Yanukovych got into office he was fast to put other Russian agents in all the key gov. positions. Just so you understand, Yanukovych put a guy who had Russian citizenship in the post of Minister of Defense of Ukraine. Yanukovych and his people destroyed the Ukrainian army by  systematic  dismantling and shutting down departments; and   in 4 years, stole the country's budget. Because of this, Ukraine  was  absolutely unprepared for the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Russian ""green men"" in east Ukraine 2014.


I'm not the smartest person in the world,...? BUT?how come Trump is the only president to ever sucked up to Russia, and look how quick he's collapsing the US  economy and now the US   Allies turning their backs to America, starting a trade war with of all countries Canada   and Mexico  

Americans! You are now in the same situation as Ukraine  was when Ukraines government with  Yanukovych  was de-facto under control of a Russian agent . Your so-called president is a KGB recruit, agent  his code name is ""Krasnov"". (dont believe me look it up   ) This has already been confirmed from various sources. And what he does now confirms it even more. Just look at who he appoints to key positions. How he betrays Ukraine and European allies. How he idolizes Putin. What other signals do you need to start acting?

NB?TAKE?A?LOOK?AND?JUST?GOOGLE?(British lawmaker Graham Stuart raised the possibility that the president of the United States, Donald Trump, had been groomed by the Kremlin¡¯s security services over a period of decades. )

"Oh wow, another brilliant take from the 24-hour news cycle.  Imagine actually understanding economics and trade, instead of just regurgitating whatever narrative fits the agenda. 

So let¡¯s break this down real slow for the people in the back: Trump imposes tariffs to level the playing field with China, Mexico, and Canada, and somehow¡¦ that¡¯s a bad thing? ?? Oh no, how dare America try to stop hemorrhaging money overseas and actually protect its own industries. 

 Trade Imbalances? Never Heard of Them!
For decades, the U.S. has been getting absolutely fleeced by countries that love to sell us their stuff but conveniently don¡¯t want to buy anything from us. China? $295 billion trade deficit. Mexico? $172 billion. Even our ¡°friendly¡± neighbor Canada? $63 billion. But yeah, sure, let¡¯s just keep bending over for them. ??

 Tariffs = Bad? Nah, It¡¯s Called Smart Business.
The media loves pretending these tariffs are just Trump throwing a tantrum, when in reality, it¡¯s about forcing fair trade. You know, that thing where both sides actually benefit instead of one side (us) getting milked dry like a cash cow. 

 ¡°But But But¡¦ It¡¯ll Raise Prices!!¡±
Oh, you mean the price of cheap garbage made with slave labor might go up a little? ?? Meanwhile, American factories get a fighting chance to actually produce again? Yeah, I think we¡¯ll manage. Besides, y¡¯all weren¡¯t complaining when inflation was eating your paycheck alive. Funny how that works. 

 And Let¡¯s Not Forget China¡¯s Side Hustle?Fentanyl.
You think this is just about trade? Let¡¯s talk about how China¡¯s been flooding the U.S. with fentanyl, killing hundreds of thousands of people. But sure, let¡¯s cry about tariffs instead of the fact that China literally enables a deadly drug epidemic. ???¡Î?

 Bottom Line:
Trump¡¯s playing the long game here. Of course, the media won¡¯t get it?they¡¯re too busy clutching their pearls because America First sounds like a bad thing to them.  Meanwhile, the real world knows: fair trade, strong industry, and holding China accountable = long-term economic security. But hey, let¡¯s just keep listening to the same people who told us outsourcing all our jobs was a good idea. What could possibly go wrong? ??",1 month ago,MSNBC,

Perhaps it¡¯s time to invest a little more in education?

Trump for the win suckerz! Start cryin,1 month ago,MSNBC,
"Oh wow, another brilliant take from the 24-hour news cycle.  Imagine actually understanding economics and trade, instead of just regurgitating whatever narrative fits the agenda. 

So let¡¯s break this down real slow for the people in the back: Trump imposes tariffs to level the playing field with China, Mexico, and Canada, and somehow¡¦ that¡¯s a bad thing? ?? Oh no, how dare America try to stop hemorrhaging money overseas and actually protect its own industries. 

 Trade Imbalances? Never Heard of Them!
For decades, the U.S. has been getting absolutely fleeced by countries that love to sell us their stuff but conveniently don¡¯t want to buy anything from us. China? $295 billion trade deficit. Mexico? $172 billion. Even our ¡°friendly¡± neighbor Canada? $63 billion. But yeah, sure, let¡¯s just keep bending over for them. ??

 Tariffs = Bad? Nah, It¡¯s Called Smart Business.
The media loves pretending these tariffs are just Trump throwing a tantrum, when in reality, it¡¯s about forcing fair trade. You know, that thing where both sides actually benefit instead of one side (us) getting milked dry like a cash cow. 

 ¡°But But But¡¦ It¡¯ll Raise Prices!!¡±
Oh, you mean the price of cheap garbage made with slave labor might go up a little? ?? Meanwhile, American factories get a fighting chance to actually produce again? Yeah, I think we¡¯ll manage. Besides, y¡¯all weren¡¯t complaining when inflation was eating your paycheck alive. Funny how that works. 

 And Let¡¯s Not Forget China¡¯s Side Hustle?Fentanyl.
You think this is just about trade? Let¡¯s talk about how China¡¯s been flooding the U.S. with fentanyl, killing hundreds of thousands of people. But sure, let¡¯s cry about tariffs instead of the fact that China literally enables a deadly drug epidemic. ???¡Î?

 Bottom Line:
Trump¡¯s playing the long game here. Of course, the media won¡¯t get it?they¡¯re too busy clutching their pearls because America First sounds like a bad thing to them.  Meanwhile, the real world knows: fair trade, strong industry, and holding China accountable = long-term economic security. But hey, let¡¯s just keep listening to the same people who told us outsourcing all our jobs was a good idea. What could possibly go wrong? ??",1 month ago,MSNBC,

"If you took ten minutes, or put some of those unpaid interns on it, you would know that the effect of tariffs is to protect Americans.  But given that you don't give a crap about Americans as long as you can get cheap chinese nonsense, I guess this is fitting.
Tariffs raise the cost of good entering the nation.  This lets higher paid American workers compete with people in Mexico making 17.00 a day, and chinese making about 50% of the amount we make in this nation.
The other benefit of tariffs is it gives the federal government money, easing the tax burdens on US taxpayers.
So it is a win/win.

So when the other nations also charge tariffs?  It doesn't hurt Americans, in fact, it gives them incentive to bring sales home, and compete with other US businesses.  Now, drop the idiotic and outrageous taxes - like the one you pay for gasoline... you know the one?  Where the US gas makers aren't using cellulose alcohol like the law requires?  Oh, not heard of it?  There's a REASON for that!  It doesn't EXIST.  But you pay the fine for that every time you put gas in your car.

But hey, if you care so damned little about the USA, it's workers, it's business and it's people, then MOVE to Canada or Mexico, and you'll not have to pay the money.  

As for the rest... it's pretty clear you've never read a history book, researched the subject, or have any idea what you're talking about.  Tariffs ALWAYS inject large amounts of money in the the federal government, which is then supposed to be used to provide needed and necessary services... instead of spending 8,000.00 on an HDMI cable with a company that makes them for 4.00, then donates 4,000 back to the politician who got them the idiotic contract.

"Trump can be called ""Reverse President"", or ""Pause President"", or ""Motormouth President"". His favourite word in his second term is 'tariff'. His tariff tanks the stock and he pause it. Not only this, his right-hand man, Elon Musk, who know nothing about governance also face tanking of his Tesla stock. He is a round peg in a square hole. Musk want to pause the tariff because his Tesla stock is in tailspin fall. One really don't know what these two fellows (felon) will do with the US. They are leading US to depression. Every price is going up, obviously. Abraham Lincoln once said that ""half of Americans are wise"" is turning out to be true. First of all you chose a convicted person as president for the first time in US history. Now you cannot cry. He will lead US to the drain. He is biting more than he can chew. Trade war with every nation. Pausing of tariff will not do. The damage has been done. Canada and Mexico are doing business with China and EU and Asia bypassing US. So, enjoy the coming 4 years.
